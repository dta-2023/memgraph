# 1. Introduction

---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to interact with a graph database using **Memgraph** and **Python**.  
The goal is to understand how to model and query data in the form of nodes and relationships, while applying this knowledge to a realistic use case: **fraud detection through invoice analysis**.

This documentation is intended for beginners in graph databases, but assumes basic familiarity with Python.

---

## üåê What is Memgraph?

**Memgraph** is a high-performance, **in-memory graph database** that supports the **Cypher** query language (just like Neo4j).  
It is especially suited for real-time graph analysis and use cases such as:

- Recommendation systems (personalized suggestions)
- Fraud detection
- Social network analysis
- Transport/logistics graph modeling

---

## üêç Why use Python with Memgraph?

Cypher allows you to interact directly with Memgraph through the command line or visual tools like **Memgraph Lab**.  
But **Python** offers additional advantages:

- Automate interactions with the database
- Write graph analysis scripts
- Integrate Memgraph into web applications or data pipelines
- Visualize data using libraries like `networkx` or `matplotlib`

---

## üß™ What will we build?

We will simulate a system where:
- **drivers** send **invoices**
- which are paid into **bank accounts**

The goal is to build a simple graph of these entities and then:
- learn to create and query it using Python,
- and eventually, **detect suspicious patterns** like multiple drivers using the same IBAN number.

üëâ The purpose of this documentation is to teach you how to interact with Memgraph **through Python**, using step-by-step tutorials and practical exercises.

---

# 2. Setting up Python to use Memgraph with GQLAlchemy

> GQLAlchemy is an open-source Python library developed by Memgraph.  
> It works as an **Object Graph Mapper (OGM)**, meaning it lets you manipulate graph data using Python objects instead of manually writing Cypher queries.  
> It is compatible with **Memgraph** and **Neo4j**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility

- ‚ùå **Python 3.11 on Windows**: Not supported with GQLAlchemy  
- ‚úÖ Recommended versions: **Python 3.8 to 3.10**  
- üß™ Recommended environment: `venv` or `conda`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Create your project folder

```bash
mkdir memgraph_python
cd memgraph_python
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows
```

### 3. Install GQLAlchemy via pip

```bash
pip install gqlalchemy
```

---

## üöÄ Simple connection to Memgraph

Create a file named `program.py` with the following content:

```python
from gqlalchemy import Memgraph

# Connect to Memgraph (make sure port 7687 is exposed)
memgraph = Memgraph(host="127.0.0.1", port=7687)

# Delete existing data (optional)
memgraph.execute("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n")

# Create a test node
query = """
CREATE (n:FirstNode)
SET n.message = '{message}'
RETURN 'Node ' + id(n) + ': ' + n.message AS result
""".format(message="Hello, World!")

# Execute the query
results = memgraph.execute_and_fetch(query)

# Display the result
print(list(results)[0]['result'])
```

Run the script:

```bash
python program.py
```

---

## üí° If the connection fails (common with Docker)

> Docker may assign a different internal IP instead of `127.0.0.1`.

To get the actual container IP address:

```bash
docker ps  # Get the CONTAINER_ID of your Memgraph container
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' CONTAINER_ID
```

Then update your script:

```python
memgraph = Memgraph(host="172.17.0.2", port=7687)  # Example IP
```

## üìå Important Notes

- Memgraph uses **port 7687** with the **Bolt** protocol  
- You can write raw Cypher queries directly in Python with `gqlalchemy`  
- You can also use **Memgraph Lab** at http://localhost:3000 to visualize your graph data

---

## üîÅ Alternatives to `gqlalchemy`

Before diving deeper into GQLAlchemy, it‚Äôs useful to know other tools that can also interact with graph databases like Memgraph or Neo4j.

---

## üß© Why Memgraph shows the Neo4j driver first

Memgraph‚Äôs official Quick Start starts with the Neo4j driver because:

- It‚Äôs widely recognized by Python developers  
- It allows you to quickly run Cypher queries  
- It demonstrates that **Memgraph is fully Cypher-compatible**

However, for production-ready Python projects that require clarity, structure, and maintainability,  
**`gqlalchemy` is the preferred tool**.

# 3. Building and Querying a Graph in Memgraph with Python (`gqlalchemy`)

---

## üåü What you‚Äôll learn in this section

In this section, you will learn how to:

- Use `gqlalchemy`'s **query builder** methods: `create()`, `match()`, `to()`, `from_()`, etc.
- Create **nodes** and **relationships** in your graph using Python
- Use the `Memgraph` object to send queries
- Use the methods `execute()` and `execute_and_fetch()`
- Build a small invoice fraud scenario
- Perform **fraud detection**: e.g. multiple drivers using the same IBAN

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section assumes you already understand the basics of the Cypher language (covered in your teammate‚Äôs section).  
> Here, we focus on **how to implement those queries in Python using `gqlalchemy`**.

---

## üìò Core concepts of `gqlalchemy`

`gqlalchemy` allows you to write Cypher queries using a **Pythonic syntax**, known as a **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**. This makes your queries more readable and structured.

| Method                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Memgraph()`               | Creates a connection to the Memgraph database                               |
| `.execute()`               | Runs a Cypher query **without returning data**                              |
| `.execute_and_fetch()`     | Runs a Cypher query **with RETURN**, and fetches the results as a Python dict |
| `create()`                 | Starts a Cypher `CREATE` query                                              |
| `match()`                  | Starts a `MATCH` clause to find existing nodes/relationships                 |
| `.node()`                  | Adds a node to your query (can include labels, properties, variable)         |
| `.to()` / `.from_()`       | Defines a directed relationship between two nodes                           |
| `return_()`                | Defines what variables to return                                            |
| `limit()`, `order_by()`    | Filters or sorts query results                                              |

## üìÇ Connecting to Memgraph

```python
from gqlalchemy import Memgraph

memgraph = Memgraph(host="127.0.0.1", port=7687)
```

> Make sure Memgraph is running on port 7687 (via Docker or locally).

---

## üßπ Wipe the graph (optional)

```python
memgraph.execute("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n")
```

> This deletes all nodes and relationships in the graph.  
> It's useful when testing or resetting your data.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Creating nodes with `create().node()`

### üß† Syntax Overview

The method `create().node()` lets you define a new node by passing:

- A **label** (e.g. `"Person"`, `"Invoice"`, `"Driver"`)
- One or more **properties** using keyword arguments

#### üßæ General syntax:

```python
create().node(labels="Label", key1=value1, key2=value2).execute()
```

This is equivalent to the following Cypher query:

```cypher
CREATE (:Label {key1: value1, key2: value2})
```

---

### üí° Examples: Creating nodes

```python
from gqlalchemy import create

# Create drivers
create().node(labels="Driver", name="John Doe", id="D001").execute()
create().node(labels="Driver", name="Jane Smith", id="D002").execute()
create().node(labels="Driver", name="Fake Driver", id="D003").execute()

# Create invoices
create().node(labels="Invoice", invoice_id="F001", amount=9500).execute()
create().node(labels="Invoice", invoice_id="F002", amount=9700).execute()
create().node(labels="Invoice", invoice_id="F003", amount=9500).execute()

# Create a bank account
create().node(labels="Bank", iban="CH93-0000-0000-0000-0001").execute()
```

---

## üîó Creating relationships with `match()` + `.to()` / `.from_()`

### üß† Syntax Overview

To create a relationship **between existing nodes**, you should:

1. Use `match()` to find both nodes  
2. Use `create()` to define the relationship between them

#### üßæ General syntax:

```python
match()
  .node(labels="LabelA", property="value", variable="a")
  .match()
  .node(labels="LabelB", property="value", variable="b")
  .create()
  .node(variable="a").to("RELATIONSHIP").node(variable="b")
  .execute()
```

This creates a directed Cypher relationship:

```cypher
MATCH (a:LabelA {property: value}), (b:LabelB {property: value})
CREATE (a)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(b)
```

---

### üí° Example: Create a `SENT` relationship

```python
from gqlalchemy import match

match()
  .node(labels="Driver", name="John Doe", variable="driver")
  .match()
  .node(labels="Invoice", invoice_id="F001", variable="invoice")
  .create()
  .node(variable="driver").to("SENT").node(variable="invoice")
  .execute()
```

---

## üîç Fetching data with `execute_and_fetch()`

### üß† Syntax Overview

Use `execute_and_fetch()` when your query includes a `RETURN` clause.  
It allows you to retrieve results as Python dictionaries.

#### üßæ General syntax:

```python
result = memgraph.execute_and_fetch("""
  YOUR CYPHER QUERY HERE
""")

for row in result:
    print(row["your_variable"])
```

---

### üí° Example: fraud detection query

```python
results = memgraph.execute_and_fetch("""
MATCH (d:Driver)-[:SENT]->(:Invoice)-[:PAID_INTO]->(b:Bank)
WITH b.iban AS iban, collect(DISTINCT d.name) AS drivers, count(DISTINCT d.name) AS nb
WHERE nb > 1
RETURN iban, drivers, nb
""")

for row in results:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è IBAN {row['iban']} used by {row['nb']} drivers: {row['drivers']}")
```

### ‚úÖ Expected output:

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è IBAN CH93-0000-0000-0000-0001 used by 3 drivers: ['John Doe', 'Jane Smith', 'Fake Driver']
```

---

## 4. Working with Graph Data using `gqlalchemy`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Some operations shown here (like updating or deleting nodes) are done using **raw Cypher executed via Python** (`memgraph.execute("...")`).  
> This is normal ‚Äî the `gqlalchemy` query builder doesn‚Äôt cover all use cases yet. It‚Äôs common practice to use raw Cypher when it simplifies your logic or increases flexibility.

---

### üß† Goal of this section

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to manipulate graph data in Memgraph using Python and `gqlalchemy`. This includes:

- Reading existing nodes and relationships
- Updating node properties
- Deleting nodes or relationships
- Filtering data using `WHERE` and conditional queries

> These operations are essential when refining your graph to reflect business needs (e.g., invoice updates, bank account deletion, etc.)

---

### üîç Reading nodes and relationships

#### General syntax

```python
match()
  .node(labels="Label", variable="n")
  .return_()
  .execute()
```

#### Example: read all drivers

```python
from gqlalchemy import match

results = match().node(labels="Driver", variable="d").return_().execute()
for r in results:
    print(r["d"])
```

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Updating a property

> Use a raw Cypher query through `execute()` to update an existing node.

#### Example: change a driver's name

```python
memgraph.execute("""
MATCH (d:Driver {id: 'D001'})
SET d.name = 'John Updated'
""")
```

---

### üóë Deleting a node or relationship

#### Delete a node (and its relationships)

```python
memgraph.execute("""
MATCH (n:Bank {iban: 'CH93-0000-0000-0000-0001'})
DETACH DELETE n
""")
```

#### Delete only a relationship

```python
memgraph.execute("""
MATCH (:Driver {name: 'John Doe'})-[r:SENT]->(:Invoice {invoice_id: 'F001'})
DELETE r
""")
```

> `DETACH DELETE` removes the node and all its connected relationships.

---

### üîç Filtering with `WHERE`

#### Example: list all invoices greater than 9000 CHF

```python
results = memgraph.execute_and_fetch("""
MATCH (i:Invoice)
WHERE i.amount > 9000
RETURN i.invoice_id, i.amount
""")
for r in results:
    print(r)
```

#### Example: find all drivers whose name starts with "J"

```python
results = memgraph.execute_and_fetch("""
MATCH (d:Driver)
WHERE d.name STARTS WITH 'J'
RETURN d.name
""")
for r in results:
    print(r)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

By now, you should be able to:

- Read nodes using labels or filters
- Update existing data in your graph
- Delete nodes or specific relationships
- Use `WHERE` to refine your queries

These techniques make your graph dynamic and adaptable to real-world business logic.
